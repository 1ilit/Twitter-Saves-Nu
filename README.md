# Twitter Saves Nu

A twitter bot that allows users to play a game together by liking or retweeting the post.

In a galaxy far-far away from ours a war broke out. 

It all started on a peaceful Wednesday night when the night-sky was suddenly lit by a wave of asteroid bombs. The ground was quacking, it was raining fire, and screams could be heard everywhere. The emperor of Pleiades had invaded Auria to expand its terratory and once again remind the galaxy of his terrifying power. 

Nu is among the many children that were captured and sent to a camp far from home. The only way out is through a maze that is said to be 'the maze that drains time and space.'

Nu is lost and scared. Guide Nu to the end of the maze and help him escape.

      |             //and likes > retweets move him W

## Features
- DFS random maze generator
- Implemeting the Twitter4J library

## Improvements
- I think the controls can be optimized
- Some tile system can be used to make the code cleaner
